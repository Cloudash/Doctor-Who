      <p>The Rescue is the third serial of the second season of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who, which was first broadcast in two weekly parts on 2 January and 9 January 1965 on BBC1. It was written by outgoing story editor David Whitaker and directed by Christopher Barry.</p>
      <p> The Rescue was produced in a six-episode block with The Romans and was the first story produced in Doctor Who '​s second production block. Rehearsals and recording took place from 30 November to 11 December 1964, entirely in-studio. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The two episodes were watched by 12 and 13 million viewers in the UK respectively and have received generally positive reviews from critics, who praise the character-based storytelling, although plot holes were noted. Both episodes of The Rescue have been retained in the BBC archives, and the story has been novelised and released on VHS and DVD. </p>
      <p> The serial is notable as the first appearance of Maureen O'Brien as companion Vicki.</p>
